        "**Q3.** This is a basic review of some statistics along with practice writing functions. Like we talked about, Python is a general purpose programming language and ships without basic data handling or statistical packages coded in. The beginning of the code chunk below generates random values for you to test your work on; since the random values are generates as NumPy arrays, you'll need to use the Numpy methods `np.sum(x)` to sum the vector $x$ and `np.sqrt(x)` to take the square roots of the values in $x$, as well as the Python function `len(x)` to get the length of $x$.\n",
